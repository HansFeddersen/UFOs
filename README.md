Data Bootcamp Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to create an html website with tables and filters using JavaScript. We are given a series of UFO's sightings in the US, where each has a date (datetime), city, state, country, shape of the sighting (shape), duration and comments. To have a complete website, we had to write the index.html, the app.js (which were connected with the data.js) and a stly.css to customize the site. 



## Resources
**For this analysis, the following resources were used**:
- Data Sources: data.js



## Results

**Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.**

- The website is pretty simple, but it allows the user to filter according to a certain criteria. First there is a description of the page, with a title, an image and an introduction:

![This is an image](https://github.com/HansFeddersen/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Intro.png)

-In the bottom part of the website, the user can filter out, by writing the desired criteria in the respective box (it is not necessary to fill out all the boxes, but it can be done for a more specific filter). Examples as follows:

First, the table with no filters applied:

![This is an image](https://github.com/HansFeddersen/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/no_filter.png)

Second, the table with only one filter applied:

![This is an image](https://github.com/HansFeddersen/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/one_filter.png)


Third, the table with two filters applied:

Summary:


**One drawback of this new design**

- The website doesn’t have tools so the user can add extra data in case that he wants to report a new sighting. Also, it doesn’t have pictures (or links leading to pictures) so the users can have evidence of the sightings and draw their own conclusions.

**Two recommendations for further development**

- Give the opportunity to the user to add data, or to support the already existing data by adding a witness counter to every reported sighting (where the user can click that he also saw it).

- The possibility to sort the data of the table (for example sort by duration and descendant order).
