Data Bootcamp Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to create an html website with tables and filters using JavaScript. We are given a series of UFO's sightings in the US, where each has a date (datetime), city, state, country, shape of the sighting (shape), duration and comments. To have a complete website, we had to write the index.html, the app.js (which were connected with the data.js) and a stly.css to customize the site. 



## Resources
**For this analysis, the following resources were used**:
- Data Sources: data.js



## Results

**Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.**

- The website is pretty simple, but it allows the user to filter according a certain criteria. First there is a description of the page, with a title, an image and an introduction:

![This is an image](https://github.com/HansFeddersen/surfs_up/blob/main/More/Temperatures_recorded.png)

-In the bottom part of the website, the user can filter out, by writing the desired criteria in the respective box (it is not necessary to fill out all the boxes, but it can be done for a more specific filter). Examples as follows:

First, the table with no fitlers applied:

Second, the table with only one filter applied:

Third, the table with two filters applied:

Summary:


**One drawback of this new design**

- We can add a query to obtain the precipitation levels for both months and that way have a more complex study. In that case, the query would be as follows:

**Two recommendations for further development**
